Webpack is great tool. I can see with every project why frameworks like Vue and React were created. Dom manipulation with vanilla JS is certainly Doable, but comes with a unique set of problems.

This is "The Double Scoop" site. A completely fictional, but rad ice cream shop.

I tried really hard on the styling of this site, but I know it is not responsive, and is really for desktop only at this moment. I Would like to spend more on styling, and will comeback and make it more responsive. It would be a great way to practice more CSS. But I digress, More JS to learn!
